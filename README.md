# Custom_Routing_Protocol

## Project Brief:
This project is an interactive network simulator built with Python that visually demonstrates and compares core routing algorithms. Users can dynamically create and modify network topologies, test link failures, and find the shortest paths using both Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's algorithms.
## KEY FEATURES:
-**Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter to add/remove routers and links.

-**Algorithm Comparison**: Implements both Dijkstra's Algorithm (for non-negative weights) and the Bellman-Ford Algorithm (to handle negative weights and detect negative cycles).

-**Dynamic Visualization**: Uses matplotlib and networkx to draw the network topology in real-time.

-**Shortest Path Highlighting**: Visually highlights the calculated shortest path on the network graph.

-**Performance Metrics:** Compares the execution time of each algorithm in the console.

This tool is designed to be an educational and experimental platform for anyone learning about graph theory and the fundamental principles of network routing.
