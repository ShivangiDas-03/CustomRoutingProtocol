# CustomRoutingProtocol
This project is an interactive network simulator built with Python that visually demonstrates and compares core routing algorithms. Users can dynamically create and modify network topologies, test link failures, and find the shortest paths using both Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford's algorithms.
